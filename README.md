This repository is for the Deep Learning (DL) Course for the Master's Course 'Data Science for Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation" at JADS. 
Specifically, with this project we are aiming to make a contribution to the current state of Machine Learning based visual recognition of birds (hence our cool name).
One especially difficult challenge in this field is to detecting sitting birds.

Our project aims to create an accurate and fast solution for the challenge at hand. 

**IMPORTANT**
- Change the path to the data in the data.yaml file. It requires a full path to the data folder.
- Next to installing the requirements, you need to manually run 'python -m pip install albumentations==1.0.3' in the terminal.
